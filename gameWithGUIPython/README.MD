# 2048 Game in Python (Pygame)

## Overview

This is an implementation of the popular 2048 game using the Python **Pygame** library. The game is a sliding puzzle where the objective is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the value **2048** or higher. The game is visually enhanced with a GUI, animations, and additional features to improve gameplay.

   - Save scores to a leaderboard to encourage replayability.

3. **Undo Feature**:
   - Allows players to undo their last move to recover from mistakes.

4. **Animations**:
   - Smooth animations for tile movements and merging using Pygame's `time.Clock`.

5. **Difficulty Levels**:
   - Choose between Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert difficulty levels.
   - Starting configurations vary by difficulty, with added challenges for advanced players.

6. **Improved Visuals**:
   - Tile shadows and gradients for a polished design.
   - Enhanced visual feedback for merging tiles.
