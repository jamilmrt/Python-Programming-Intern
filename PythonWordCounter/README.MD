# Word Counter

## Overview

The Word Counter is a simple Python program designed to count the number of words in a given sentence or paragraph. This project aims to strengthen understanding and application of Python programming concepts such as input handling, string manipulation, function creation, and basic control flow.

## Objectives

- To accurately count the number of words in user-provided text.
- To practice creating modular code using functions.
- To implement error handling for user input.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Features

- **User  Input**: Prompts the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.
- **Word Counting Logic**: Implements a function that counts the number of words in the input text.
- **Output Display**: Displays the word count to the console.
- **Error Handling**: Accounts for empty input and provides appropriate feedback.
- **Code Comments**: Includes comments to explain the purpose of different parts of the code.

## Code Structure
- **count_words(text)**: A function that takes a string input and returns the count of words.
- **main()**: The main function that handles user input and output.
The script is designed to run when executed directly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory containing the `word_counter.py` file.
3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   python word_counter.py
 - Error: You entered an empty input. Please enter a valid sentence or paragraph.
